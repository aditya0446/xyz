    "In Python, a generator function is a special type of function that generates a sequence of values using the `yield` keyword. Unlike regular functions that return a value and terminate, generator functions can yield multiple values one at a time, and they maintain their internal state between each yield.\n",

    "The main advantages of using generator functions and the `yield` keyword are:\n",
    "1. Memory efficiency: Generator functions generate values on-the-fly, so they don't need to store the entire sequence in memory at once. This makes them memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences.\n",
    "2. Lazy evaluation: Generator functions follow a \"lazy\" evaluation approach, which means they produce values only when requested. This can be useful when working with large datasets or when you only need a subset of values from a potentially infinite sequence.\n",
